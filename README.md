A collection of React Examples built using different tools like vite and Next.js

These are simple examples like a ToDo (more to be added)

1. `vite/todo` This is a basic todo that uses local state.
2. `vite/todo_componentized` Expands on the first example, but breaks it up into components and data and types moved into separate files.
3. `nextjs/todo` Ports `vite/todo_componetized` to Next.js
4. `expo/todo-react-native-paper` stand alone React Native todo app built using the React Native Paper UI component library.
