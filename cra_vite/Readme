Some demos (typical basics/interview samples) for React App (vite)

Scaffold (or create) a new project using vite:

`npm create vite@latest`

Then follow the prompts.

Note: typescript vs typescript + swc - swc is a faster bundler/compiler

Note: this will ask for a project name and creates a folder of that name.

Then `npm install` (maybe `npm ci` would also work here)
Run with `npm run dev`
